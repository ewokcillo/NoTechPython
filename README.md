# The Problem
The next Christmas we have an event with developers from different departments, in the event we'll do groups and
 we want to avoid that the developers from the same department are in the same group.

The developers and the department are in the developers_departments.csv
 and the rooms are in rooms.json


We need a program to set the groups for each room.
